# Object_Tracking_3D

The code is for object tracking in 3D image volume sequences. 

The input should be a MAT file containing a 3D volume sequence. In each volume, background voxels are labeled as zero, and the voxels belonging to the same object are assign with the same but unique label. 

The output is similar, but the labels of each object in different frames will keep consistent.
